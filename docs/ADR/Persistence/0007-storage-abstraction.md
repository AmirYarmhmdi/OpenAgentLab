# ADR-0007: Introduce a Storage Abstraction Layer

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-08-05

---

# Context

OpenAgentLab stores uploaded files before they are processed.

The MVP uses the local filesystem, but future deployments may require cloud object storage.

The application should avoid coupling business logic to a specific storage provider.

Supported storage backends may evolve over time.

---

# Decision

OpenAgentLab introduces a Storage Abstraction Layer.

All file operations shall be performed through a common Storage Provider interface.

Application components must never interact directly with the filesystem.

---

# Storage Interface

```python
class StorageProvider(ABC):

    def upload(...):
        ...

    def download(...):
        ...

    def delete(...):
        ...

    def exists(...):
        ...

    def generate_uri(...):
        ...
```

---

# Initial Implementation

```
LocalStorageProvider
```

Future implementations:

- AzureBlobStorageProvider
- S3StorageProvider
- MinIOStorageProvider
- GoogleCloudStorageProvider

---

# Alternatives Considered

## Direct Filesystem Access

Advantages

- Very simple

Disadvantages

- Tight coupling
- Difficult cloud migration
- Harder testing

Decision

Rejected.

---

## Cloud SDK Everywhere

Advantages

- Direct provider access

Disadvantages

- Vendor lock-in
- Difficult provider replacement

Decision

Rejected.

---

# Consequences

Positive

- Storage provider independence
- Easier testing
- Cleaner architecture
- Future cloud migration without business logic changes

Negative

- One additional abstraction layer
- Slight implementation overhead

---

# Architecture Impact

The Storage Layer becomes the single entry point for file operations.

Business logic interacts only with StorageProvider.

The selected implementation is resolved through dependency injection.

---

# Future Considerations

Future versions may support:

- Object versioning
- Signed URLs
- CDN integration
- Multi-region storage
- Lifecycle policies

These features should be implemented inside Storage Providers without impacting application services.
