# Tool Specification

> This document defines the deterministic tools available to the OpenAgentLab agent.
>
> Tools perform deterministic operations.
>
> They do not make decisions.
>
> The LLM is responsible for deciding **when** a tool should be used.
> The tool is responsible for performing **how** the operation is executed.

# Design Principles

Every tool shall:

- have a single responsibility
- be deterministic whenever possible
- be independently testable
- expose typed inputs and outputs
- avoid business logic
- avoid LLM reasoning
- return structured results
- expose meaningful error messages

---

# Tool Lifecycle

# Tool Invocation Rules

The agent shall invoke tools only when:

- sufficient inputs exist

- required files exist

- workflow planning completed

- previous dependencies completed

The agent shall NOT invoke tools:

- with missing inputs

- when deterministic execution is unnecessary

- if validation fails

---

# Tool Execution Policy

The LLM SHALL

- select tools

- order execution

- interpret outputs

The LLM SHALL NOT

- perform numerical computation

- parse spreadsheets

- calculate statistics

- generate charts

These tasks belong to deterministic tools.

---

# Error Handling

Every tool shall return structured errors.

Example

```json
{
  "status":"failed",
  "error_code":"FILE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message":"Requested document does not exist."
}
```

The agent should decide how to recover.

---

# Observability

Every tool invocation shall record:

- tool name

- inputs

- execution time

- success/failure

- output metadata

- trace id

Future implementation:

Langfuse

OpenTelemetry

---

# Security Constraints

Tools shall never:

- execute arbitrary shell commands

- expose API keys

- modify uploaded files

- bypass validation

---

# Future MCP Compatibility

Every tool should eventually be exposable as an MCP Tool.

Requirements:

- typed interface

- JSON input

- JSON output

- stateless behavior

No redesign should be required.

---

# Future Tool Registry

Every tool will eventually be registered in a Tool Registry.

# Engineering Philosophy

Tools are not intelligent.

They are reliable software components.

The intelligence of OpenAgentLab emerges from the orchestration of deterministic tools rather than from the tools themselves.

This separation enables:

- explainability
- maintainability
- reproducibility
- testing
- production-grade reliability
