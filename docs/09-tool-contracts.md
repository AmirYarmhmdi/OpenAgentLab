# Tool Contracts

> This document defines the formal contracts for every deterministic tool available in OpenAgentLab.
>
> A Tool Contract specifies the expected interface, execution behavior, validation rules, error handling, and runtime guarantees.
>
> Tool Contracts act as the boundary between the Agent and the implementation.

# Traceability

## Inputs

- 08-tool-specification.md

# Contract Design Principles

Every Tool Contract shall define:

- purpose
- interface
- inputs
- outputs
- validation
- execution guarantees
- error model
- observability
- security constraints

The implementation must conform to the contract.

# Contract Compatibility

Every Tool Contract shall be compatible with:

- LangGraph Nodes
- FastAPI Endpoints
- MCP Tools
- OpenAI Tool Calling
- Anthropic Tool Use
- Future Agent Frameworks

No redesign should be required.

---

# Runtime Guarantees

Every Tool Contract guarantees:

- deterministic behavior whenever applicable
- typed inputs
- typed outputs
- explicit validation
- structured errors
- execution trace
- timeout protection
- independent testing

---

# Versioning Policy

Tool Contracts follow semantic versioning.

Examples:

```
1.0.0
```

Initial stable interface.

```
1.1.0
```

Backward-compatible additions.

```
2.0.0
```

Breaking changes.

Older versions should remain supported whenever practical.

---

# Testing Requirements

Every Tool Contract shall have:

- unit tests
- integration tests
- contract validation tests
- error handling tests
- timeout tests

Contract compliance must be verified automatically during CI.

---

# Future Extensions

Future versions may introduce:

- MCP Tool Registry
- Tool Discovery
- Tool Permissions
- Tool Capability Negotiation
- Parallel Tool Execution
- Remote Tool Invocation

The current contract model is intentionally designed to support these capabilities without requiring interface redesign.
