# User Stories

> This document translates the project vision into user-centered stories.
> The goal is to derive required system capabilities from real knowledge-worker needs, not from a predefined tool list.

---

# Design Question

The core design question for this document is:

> What do knowledge workers need to accomplish when their work spans documents, spreadsheets, data, calculations, and reports?

For OpenAgentLab, a knowledge worker is a professional who makes decisions or produces analytical outputs by combining information from multiple sources.

They do not only want a chatbot answer. They need a workspace that can:

- read source material
- analyze structured data
- compare information across files
- perform calculations
- explain how results were produced
- generate useful analytical outputs

---

# Story Design Principles

User stories should follow the project philosophy:

> The LLM coordinates work. It does not perform the work.

Each story should therefore imply:

- what the user is trying to achieve
- what sources the system must inspect
- what tools may be required
- what evidence or trace the user needs to trust the result

The stories in this document intentionally focus on user outcomes before naming technical components.

# Primary Personas

The MVP focuses on five primary personas:

1. Project Manager
2. Business Analyst
3. Engineer
4. Researcher
5. Consultant

These personas represent recurring knowledge-work patterns across planning, analysis, technical reasoning, research synthesis, and advisory work.
