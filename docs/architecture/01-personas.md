# Persona Design Principles

Personas in OpenAgentLab are **role-based**, not individual-based.

They describe categories of knowledge workers with similar goals and workflows rather than fictional users.

Each persona captures:

- business goals
- analytical challenges
- typical information sources
- expected AI assistance
- required platform capabilities

# Cross-Persona Capabilities

Regardless of the persona, OpenAgentLab should consistently provide:

- Reliable document understanding
- Multi-document reasoning
- Structured data analysis
- Deterministic tool execution
- Transparent evidence retrieval
- Explainable decision support
- Report generation
- Execution trace visibility

---

# Design Implications

These personas directly influence the design of:

- User Stories
- Functional Requirements
- Agent Architecture
- Tool Specifications
- RAG Pipeline
- Evaluation Strategy

Every major capability implemented in OpenAgentLab should support at least one documented persona.

Capabilities that do not address a real user need should not be included in the MVP.
