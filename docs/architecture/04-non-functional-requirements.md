# Quality Attributes

OpenAgentLab is designed around the following quality attributes:

- Reliability
- Performance
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Modularity
- Security
- Observability
- Explainability
- Testability
- Portability

---

# NFR-001 — Reliability

## Description

The platform shall execute analytical workflows consistently and predictably.

## Requirements

- Tool failures shall not crash the application.
- Errors shall be reported gracefully.
- Partial workflow failures shall be visible to the user.
- Deterministic tools shall produce reproducible results whenever possible.

---

# NFR-002 — Performance

## Description

The platform should provide responsive interactions during typical analytical workflows.

## Requirements

- File uploads should begin processing immediately.
- Tool execution should avoid unnecessary latency.
- Long-running workflows should expose execution progress.
- Retrieval operations should remain efficient as the document collection grows.

---

# NFR-003 — Scalability

## Description

The architecture shall support incremental growth without major redesign.

## Requirements

The system should support:

- additional tools
- additional document types
- additional LLM providers
- larger document collections
- future multi-agent workflows

---

# NFR-004 — Maintainability

## Description

The system shall be organized to simplify future development and maintenance.

## Requirements

- Components shall have clear responsibilities.
- Business logic shall remain independent from infrastructure.
- Modules should be loosely coupled.
- Documentation shall evolve alongside the implementation.

---

# NFR-005 — Modularity

## Description

Each capability should be implemented as an independent module.

## Requirements

Examples include:

- ingestion
- retrieval
- planner
- tools
- reporting
- evaluation

Each module should evolve independently whenever practical.

---

# NFR-006 — Security

## Description

The platform shall follow secure software engineering practices.

## Requirements

- Secrets shall never be stored in source code.
- Environment variables shall be used for configuration.
- Uploaded files shall be validated before processing.
- Sensitive information shall not appear in logs.
- External services shall be accessed securely.

Authentication and authorization are outside the MVP scope.

---

# NFR-007 — Observability

## Description

System behavior shall be observable throughout every analytical workflow.

## Requirements

The platform should capture:

- workflow execution
- tool invocations
- execution duration
- failures
- token usage
- LLM cost
- retrieval events

The observability layer should support integration with Langfuse and OpenTelemetry.

---

# NFR-008 — Explainability

## Description

Users should understand how an answer was produced.

## Requirements

The platform should expose:

- selected tools
- retrieved sources
- execution steps
- supporting evidence

The goal is to increase trust rather than expose internal implementation details.

---

# NFR-009 — Testability

## Description

The architecture shall support automated testing.

## Requirements

The project should include:

- unit tests
- integration tests
- evaluation datasets
- deterministic tool tests
- CI validation

AI evaluation should be supported through DeepEval and Ragas.

---

# NFR-010 — Portability

## Description

The platform should be deployable in multiple environments.

## Requirements

Supported deployment targets include:

- Local development
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Azure

Future deployment targets may include Kubernetes.

---

# NFR-011 — Configurability

## Description

Runtime behavior should be configurable without changing source code.

## Requirements

Examples include:

- model selection
- embedding model
- vector database
- API keys
- logging level
- evaluation settings

Configuration should be managed through environment variables.

---

# NFR-012 — Extensibility

## Description

The architecture shall allow future capabilities to be added with minimal impact.

## Requirements

Future extensions include:

- MCP
- additional LLM providers
- new tools
- custom workflows
- plugins
- self-hosted models

The architecture should minimize changes to existing components when introducing new capabilities.

---

# NFR-013 — Interoperability

## Description

The platform should integrate easily with external services.

## Requirements

Supported integrations may include:

- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- PostgreSQL
- Qdrant
- Langfuse
- GitHub Actions

Future integrations may include MCP-compatible services.

---

# NFR-014 — Traceability

## Description

Important architectural decisions and execution paths shall remain traceable.

## Requirements

The project should maintain traceability between:

Project Vision

↓

Personas

↓

User Stories

↓

Functional Requirements

↓

Architecture

↓

Implementation

↓

Evaluation

Execution traces should remain available for debugging and quality assessment.

---

# NFR-015 — Documentation

## Description

Documentation is considered a first-class engineering artifact.

## Requirements

The repository shall include documentation describing:

- architecture
- APIs
- tools
- deployment
- evaluation
- architectural decisions (ADR)

Documentation should evolve together with the implementation.

---

# MVP Quality Goals

The first release should demonstrate:

- production-ready project structure
- modular architecture
- deterministic tool orchestration
- explainable AI workflows
- observable execution
- automated evaluation
- reproducible local deployment

---

# Quality Philosophy

OpenAgentLab prioritizes engineering quality over feature quantity.

When trade-offs are required, the project favors:

- reliability over novelty
- modularity over convenience
- explainability over opacity
- maintainability over premature optimization
- deterministic execution over unnecessary LLM reasoning

The platform is intended to demonstrate how modern AI systems can be engineered using production-quality software engineering principles.
