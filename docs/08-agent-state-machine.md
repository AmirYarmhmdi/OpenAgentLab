# Agent State Machine

> This document defines the execution state machine of the OpenAgentLab agent.
>
> The state machine specifies **how the agent transitions between operational states** during analytical workflows.
>
> It is intentionally implementation-independent and serves as the behavioral contract for future LangGraph development.

# Traceability

## Inputs

- 02-user-stories.md
- 03-functional-requirements.md
- 07-workflow-architecture.md

## Outputs

- LangGraph implementation
- Tool orchestration logic
- Retry strategy
- Error handling implementation

# Design Philosophy

The agent is modeled as a **deterministic workflow coordinator** rather than an autonomous conversational entity.

Its responsibilities are:

- understand analytical intent
- gather evidence
- orchestrate tools
- validate results
- produce grounded answers

The agent never skips states silently.

Every transition should be observable and traceable.

# State Definitions

## State: Idle

### Purpose

Waiting for a new analytical request.

### Entry Conditions

- no active workflow
- previous workflow completed

### Exit Trigger

---

## State: Receive Request

### Responsibilities

- accept user input
- register request
- attach uploaded sources
- create workflow context

### Outputs

- Request ID
- Session Context

### Failure Conditions

- invalid request
- unsupported file type

---

## State: Understand Intent

### Responsibilities

- classify analytical task
- identify user goal
- determine required capabilities

### Example Intents

- summarize
- compare
- analyze
- calculate
- generate report
- explain

### Outputs

- Confidence Score

### Transition Rules

- High confidence → Resolve Context
- Low confidence → Ask Clarifying Question (future)

---

# Failure States

## Missing Sources

Occurs when required documents are unavailable.

System behavior:

- stop workflow
- explain missing sources
- request user action

---

## Tool Failure

Occurs when deterministic execution fails.

System behavior:

- retry
- isolate failure
- continue when possible
- report limitations

---

## Retrieval Failure

Occurs when no relevant evidence is found.

System behavior:

- continue with available context
- explicitly communicate low evidence confidence

---

## LLM Failure

Occurs when the language model is unavailable.

System behavior:

- preserve workflow state
- allow future resume
- report temporary failure

---

# Observability Events

Each state transition should emit an event.

Example:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "wf_001",
  "from_state": "Plan Workflow",
  "to_state": "Execute Tools",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "duration_ms": 124
}
```

These events will later be captured by Langfuse.

| State | Future LangGraph Node |
|--------|----------------------|
| Receive Request | InputNode |
| Understand Intent | IntentNode |
| Resolve Context | ContextNode |
| Retrieve Evidence | RetrievalNode |
| Plan Workflow | PlannerNode |
| Execute Tools | ToolExecutorNode |
| Validate Results | ValidationNode |
| Retry / Repair | RetryNode |

# Future Extensions

The state machine is intentionally designed to support future capabilities without redesigning the core workflow.

Planned extensions:

- Human Approval State
- Parallel Tool Execution
- Multi-Agent Collaboration
- MCP Tool Discovery
- Workflow Persistence
- Pause / Resume Execution
- Scheduled Workflows

These extensions should introduce new states or transitions while preserving the existing execution model.
