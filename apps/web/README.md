## General Role

The web app is a thin client for the OpenAgentLab backend. It gathers user input,
sends messages and attachments to the API, displays workflow status, and renders
recent run details. The backend remains responsible for persistence, retrieval,
agent execution, and answer generation.

## Inputs And Outcomes

| Input | Handled By | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User message text | React UI and `src/api.ts` | Multipart or JSON request to the backend. |
| File attachments | React UI and `src/api.ts` | Uploaded file metadata and workflow context. |
| Workflow list/detail responses | React UI | Visible run history, statuses, and details. |
| Build/test commands | Vite, TypeScript, Vitest | Static frontend bundle or test report. |

## Useful Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run test
